You will be prompted with questions about what you would like to do with the Employee Directory (view, add, update) and your answers will be used to interact with the database:
* Deployed application: [https://mvc-burger-application.herokuapp.com/](https://mvc-burger-application.herokuapp.com/)
* Application image: ![application image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71162422/110418644-cf605980-804c-11eb-9269-ba998245f761.png)

## Tests

1. Users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
2. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page - waiting to be devoured.
3. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Eat it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
4. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
